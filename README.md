# CrossFunkyFitness
This was a project for my mobile application development courses at Rasmussen College. This app is a fitness/health tracking app for users to keep track of workouts and food intake, view training videos for various power lifts, and get nutrition articles. The course material was split into two courses and used Dreamweaver first, then Visual Studio for the second course. Microsoft Azure was used for storage, but the account is no longer active. PhoneGap was used to compile project for use on Android phones.
